# GEF - GDB Enhanced Features #

[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-blue.svg)](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/) [![MIT](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/doctrine/orm.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://github.com/hugsy/gef/blob/main/LICENSE) [![Python 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-green.svg)](https://github.com/hugsy/gef/) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-GDB--GEF-yellow)](https://discord.gg/HCS8Hg7)

`GEF` (pronounced  §…õf - "Jeff") is a kick-ass set of commands for X86, ARM,
MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC to make GDB cool again for exploit dev. It is aimed to
be used mostly by exploit developers and reverse-engineers, to provide
additional features to GDB using the Python API to assist during the process of
dynamic analysis and exploit development.

It has full support for both Python2 and Python3 indifferently (as more and more
distros start pushing `gdb` compiled with Python3 support).

## GDB Made Easy

  * **One** single GDB script
  * Entirely **OS Agnostic**, **NO** dependencies: `GEF` is battery-included and [is installable instantly](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/#setup)
  * **Fast** limiting the number of dependencies and optimizing code to makethe commands as fast as possible
  * Provides a great variety of commands to drastically change your debugging experience in GDB.
  * [**Easily** extensible](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/api/) to create other commands by providing more comprehensible layout to GDB Python API.
  * Full Python3 support ([Python2 support was dropped in 2020.03](https://github.com/hugsy/gef/releases/tag/2020.03)) - check out [`gef-legacy`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-legacy) for a Python2 compatible version, and [the compatibility matrix](/docs/compat.md) for a complete rundown of version support.
  * Built around an architecture abstraction layer, so all commands work in any GDB-supported architecture such as x86-32/64, ARMv5/6/7, AARCH64, SPARC, MIPS, PowerPC, etc.
  * Suited for real-life debugging, exploit development, just as much as for CTFs

## Quick start

### Automated installation

GEF has no dependencies, is fully battery-included and works out of the box. You can get started with GEF in a matter of seconds, by simply running:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gef.blah.cat/sh)"
```

For more details and other ways to install GEF please see [installation page](/docs/install.md).


### Run

Then just start playing (for local files):

```bash
$ gdb -q /path/to/my/bin
gef‚û§  gef help
```

Or (for remote debugging):

```bash
remote:~ $ gdbserver 0.0.0.0:1234 /path/to/file
Running as PID: 666
```

And:

```bash
local:~ $ gdb -q
gef‚û§  gef-remote -t your.ip.address:1234 -p 666
```


## Bugs & Feedbacks ##

To discuss `gef`, `gdb`, exploitation or other topics, feel free to join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/HCS8Hg7).

For bugs or feature requests, just go [here](https://github.com/hugsy/gef/issues) and provide a thorough description if you want help.

_Side Note_: `GEF` fully relies on the GDB API and other Linux-specific sources of information (such as `/proc/<pid>`). As a consequence, some of the features might not work on custom or hardened systems such as GrSec.

## Contribution ##

`gef` was created and maintained by myself, [`@_hugsy_`](https://twitter.com/_hugsy_), but kept fresh thanks to [all the contributors](https://github.com/hugsy/gef/graphs/contributors).
