# Installing GEF

## Prerequisites

### GDB

Only [GDB 8 and higher](https://www.gnu.org/s/gdb) is required. It must be compiled with Python 3.6 or higher support. For most people, simply using your distribution package manager should be enough.

As of January 2020, GEF officially doesn't support Python 2 any longer, due to Python 2 becoming officially deprecated.

GEF will then only work for Python 3. If you absolutely require GDB + Python 2, please use [GEF-Legacy](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-legacy) instead. Note that `gef-legacy` won't provide new features, and only functional bugs will be handled.

You can verify it with the following command:

```bash
$ gdb -nx -ex 'pi print(sys.version)' -ex quit
```

This should display your version of Python compiled with `gdb`.

```bash
$ gdb -nx -ex 'pi print(sys.version)' -ex quit
3.6.9 (default, Nov  7 2019, 10:44:02)
[GCC 8.3.0]
```

### Python dependencies

There are **none**: `GEF` works out of the box!

GEF itself provides most (if not all ðŸ¤¯) features required for typical sessions. However, GEF can be easily extended via
 - community-built scripts, functions and architectures in the repo `gef-extras` (see below)
 - your own script which can leverage the GEF API for the heavy lifting


## Standalone

### Quick install

The quickest way to get started with GEF is through the installation script available. Simply make sure you have [GDB 8.0 or higher](https://www.gnu.org/s/gdb), compiled with Python 3.6 or higher, and run

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gef.blah.cat/sh)"
```

Or if you prefer `wget`
```bash
bash -c "$(wget https://gef.blah.cat/sh -O -)"
```

Alternatively from inside `gdb` directly:

```bash
$ gdb -q
(gdb) pi import urllib.request as u, tempfile as t; g=t.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='-gef.py'); open(g.name, 'wb+').write(u.urlopen('https://tinyurl.com/gef-master').read()); gdb.execute('source %s' % g.name)
```

That's it! GEF is installed and correctly set up. You can confirm it by checking the `~/.gdbinit` file and see a line that sources (i.e. loads) GEF.

```bash
$ cat ~/.gdbinit
source ~/.gdbinit-gef.py
```


### Update

If your host/VM is connected to the Internet, you can update `gef` easily to the latest version (even without `git` installed). with `python /path/to/gef.py --update`

```bash
$ python ~/.gdbinit-gef.py --update
Updated
```

This will deploy the latest version of `gef`'s _master_ branch from Github. If no updates are available, `gef` will respond `No update` instead.

## Using git

To contribute to GEF, you might prefer using git directly.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hugsy/gef.git
$ echo source `pwd`/gef/gef.py >> ~/.gdbinit
```

GEF is in very active development, so the default branch is `dev`. This is the branch you must use if you intend to submit pull requests.

However if you prefer a more stable life, you can then switch to the `master` branch:

```bash
$ git checkout master
```

The `master` branch gets only updated for new releases, or also when critical fixes occur and need to be patched urgently.


## Community repository: GEF-Extras

GEF was built to also provide a solid base for external scripts. The repository [`gef-extras`](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-extras) is an open repository where anyone can freely submit their own commands to extend GDB via GEF's API.

To benefit from it:
```bash
# using the automated way
## via the install script
$ bash -c "$(wget https://github.com/hugsy/gef/raw/master/scripts/gef-extras.sh -O -)"

# or manually
## clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/hugsy/gef-extras.git

## then specify gef to load this directory
$ gdb -ex 'gef config gef.extra_plugins_dir "/path/to/gef-extras/scripts"' -ex 'gef save' -ex quit
[+] Configuration saved
```

You can also use the structures defined from this repository:

```bash
$ gdb -ex 'gef config pcustom.struct_path "/path/to/gef-extras/structs"' -ex 'gef save' -ex quit
[+] Configuration saved
```

There, you're now fully equipped epic pwnage with **all** GEF's goodness!!
