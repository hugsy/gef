## Command `trace-run`

The `trace-run` command is meant to be provide a visual appreciation directly
in IDA disassembler of the path taken by a specific execution. It should be
used with the IDA script
[`ida_color_gdb_trace.py`](https://github.com/hugsy/stuff/blob/main/ida_scripts/ida_color_gdb_trace.py)

It will trace and store all values taken by `$pc` during the execution flow,
from its current value, until the value provided as argument.

```
gef> trace-run <address_of_last_instruction_to_trace>
```

By using the script `ida_color_gdb_trace.py` on the text file generated, it
will color the path taken:
