## Command `aslr`

Easily check, enable or disable ASLR on the debugged binary.

Check the status:
```
gef➤  aslr
ASLR is currently disabled
```

Activate ASLR:
```
gef➤  aslr on
[+] Enabling ASLR
gef➤  aslr

```

**Note**: This command cannot affect a process that has already been loaded, to
which GDB attached to later. The only way to disable this randomization is by
setting the kernel setting `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` to 0..
