## Command `vmmap`

`vmmap` displays the target process's entire memory space mapping.

Interestingly, it helps finding secret gems: as an aware reader might have
seen, memory mapping differs from one architecture to another (this is one of
the main reasons I started `GEF` in a first place). For example, you can learn
that ELF running on SPARC architectures always have their `.data` and `heap`
sections set as Read/Write/Execute.

`vmmap` accepts one argument, either a pattern to match again mapping names,
or an address to determine which section it belongs to.
