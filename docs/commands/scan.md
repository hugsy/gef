## Command `scan`

`scan` searches for addresses of one memory region (needle) inside another
region (haystack) and lists all results.

Usage:

```
gef➤  scan NEEDLE HAYSTACK
```

`scan` requires two arguments, the first is the memory section that will be
searched and the second is what will be searched for. The arguments are grepped
against the process's memory mappings (just like [vmmap](./vmmap.md)) to
determine the memory ranges to search.

```
gef➤  scan stack libc
[+] Searching for addresses in 'stack' that point to 'libc'
[stack]: 0x00007fffffffd6a8│+0x1f6a8: 0x00007ffff77cf482  →  "__tunable_get_val"
[stack]: 0x00007fffffffd6b0│+0x1f6b0: 0x00007ffff77bff78  →  0x0000001200001ab2
[stack]: 0x00007fffffffd758│+0x1f758: 0x00007ffff77cd9d0  →  0x6c5f755f72647800
[stack]: 0x00007fffffffd778│+0x1f778: 0x00007ffff77bda6c  →  0x0000090900000907
[stack]: 0x00007fffffffd7d8│+0x1f7d8: 0x00007ffff77cd9d0  →  0x6c5f755f72647800
[...]
```

### Advanced Needle/Haystack syntax ###

To check mappings without a path associated, an address range (start-end) can
be used. Note that ranges don't include whitespaces.
