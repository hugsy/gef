## Command heap ##

The `heap` command provides information on the heap chunk specified as argument. For
the moment, it only supports GlibC heap format (see
[this link](http://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/malloc/malloc.c.html#malloc_chunk)
for `malloc` structure information). Syntax to the subcommands is straight forward:

```
gef➤ heap <sub_commands>
```


### `heap chunks` command ###

Displays all the chunks from the `heap` section.

```
gef➤ heap chunks
```

In some cases, the allocation will start immediately from start of the page. If
so, specify the base address of the first chunk as follow:

```
gef➤ heap chunks <LOCATION>
```

### `heap chunkrange` command ###

Unlike 'heap chunks' this command tries (untill could read) to give information of all 
Glibc chunks started from arbitrary location and less than another location. Increment is done only via heap size field.
It might be convenient in cases when [heap] memory region is absent
and tries to gather information from all adjanced chunks to a given corrupted one for some cores.

```
gef➤ heap chunkrange <LOCATION_FROM> <LOCATION_TO>
```

![heap-chunkrange](TO_ADD)

### `heap chunk` command ###

This command gives visual information of a Glibc malloc-ed chunk. Simply
provide the address to the user memory pointer of the chunk to show the
information related to a specific chunk:

```
gef➤ heap chunk <LOCATION>
```

### `heap arenas` command ###

Multi-threaded programs have different arenas, and the knowledge of the
`main_arena` is not enough. `gef` therefore provides the `arena` sub-commands
to help you list all the arenas allocated in your program **at the moment you
call the command**.

### `heap set-arena` command ###

In cases where the debug symbol are not present (e.g. statically stripped
binary), it is possible to instruct GEF to find the `main_arena` at a different
location with the command:

```
gef➤ heap set-arena <LOCATION>
```

If the arena address is correct, all `heap` commands will be functional, and use
the specified address for `main_arena`.


### `heap bins` command ###

Glibc uses bints for keeping tracks of `free`d chunks. This is because making
allocations through `sbrk` (requiring a syscall) is costly. Glibc uses those
bins to remember formerly allocated chunks. Because bins are structured in
single or doubly linked list, I found that quite painful to always interrogate
`gdb` to get a pointer address, dereference it, get the value chunk, etc... So
I decided to implement the `heap bins` sub-command, which allows to get info
on:

   - `fastbins`
   - `bins`
      - `unsorted`
      - `small bins`
      - `large bins`


#### `heap bins fast` command ####

When exploiting heap corruption vulnerabilities, it is sometimes convenient to
know the state of the `fastbinsY` array.

The `fast` sub-command helps by displaying the list of fast chunks in this
array. Without any other argument, it will display the info of the `main_arena`
arena. It accepts an optional argument, the address of another arena (which you
can easily find using `heap arenas`).

```
gef➤ heap bins fast
[+] FastbinsY of arena 0x7ffff7dd5b20
Fastbin[0] 0x00
Fastbin[1]  →  FreeChunk(0x600310)  →  FreeChunk(0x600350)
Fastbin[2] 0x00
Fastbin[3] 0x00
Fastbin[4] 0x00
Fastbin[5] 0x00
Fastbin[6] 0x00
Fastbin[7] 0x00
Fastbin[8] 0x00
Fastbin[9] 0x00
```


#### Other `heap bins X` command ####

All the other subcommands for the `heap bins` work the same way as `fast`. If
no argument is provided, `gef` will fall back to `main_arena`. Otherwise, it
will use the address pointed as the base of the `malloc_state` structure and
print out information accordingly.
