## Command `gef-remote`

[`target remote`](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Debugging.html#Remote-Debugging) is the traditional GDB way of debugging process or system remotely. However this command by itself does a limited job (80's bandwith FTW) to collect more information about the target, making the process of debugging more cumbersome. GEF greatly improves that state with the `gef-remote` command.

📝 **Note**: If using GEF, `gef-remote` **must** be your way or debugging remote processes, never `target remote`. Maintainers will not provide support or help if you decide to use the traditional `target remote` command. For many reasons, you **cannot** use `target remote` alone with GEF.

`gef-remote` can function in 2 ways:
 - `remote` which is meant to enrich use of GDB `target remote` command, when connecting to a "real" gdbserver instance
 - `qemu-mode` when connecting to GDB stab of either `qemu-user` or `qemu-system`.

The reason for this difference being that Qemu provides *a lot* less information that GEF can extract to enrich debugging. Whereas GDBServer allows to download remote file (therefore allowing to create a small identical environment), GDB stub in Qemu does not support file transfer. As a consequence, in order to use GEF in qemu mode, it is required to provide the binary being debugged. GEF will create a mock (limited) environment so that all its most useful features are available.

### Remote mode

#### `remote`

If you want to remotely debug a binary that you already have, you simply need to tell to `gdb` where to find the debug information.

For example, if we want to debug `uname`, we do on the server:

```
$ gdbserver  :1234 /tmp/default.out
Process /tmp/default.out created; pid = 258932
Listening on port 1234
```

On the client, when the original `gdb` would use `target remote`, GEF's syntax is roughly similar (shown running in debug mode for more verbose output, but you don't have to):

```
$ gdb -ex 'gef config gef.debug 1'
GEF for linux ready, type `gef' to start, `gef config' to configure

And finally breaking into the program, showing the current context:

You will also notice the prompt has changed to indicate the debugging mode is now "remote". Besides that, all of GEF features are available:

#### `remote-extended`

Extended mode works the same as `remote`. Being an extended session, gdbserver has not spawned or attached to any process. Therefore, all that's required is to add the `--pid` flag when calling `gef-remote`, along with the process ID of the process to debug.


### Qemu mode

Qemu mode of `gef-remote` allows to connect to the [Qemu GDB stub](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/gdb.html) which allows to live debug into either a binary (`qemu-user`) or even the kernel (`qemu-system`), of any architecture supported by GEF, which makes now even more sense 😉 And using it is very straight forward.

#### `qemu-user`

 1. Run `qemu-x86_64 :1234 /bin/ls`
 2. Use `--qemu-user` and `--qemu-binary /bin/ls` when starting `gef-remote`

#### `qemu-system`

To test locally, you can use the mini image linux x64 vm [here](https://mega.nz/file/ldQCDQiR#yJWJ8RXAHTxREKVmR7Hnfr70tIAQDFeWSYj96SvPO1k).
 1. Run `./run.sh`
 2. Use `--qemu-user` and `--qemu-binary vmlinuz` when starting `gef-remote`
