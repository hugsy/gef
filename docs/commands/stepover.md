## Command `stepover`

The stepover command simplifies the process of stepping over instructions by continuing to a
temporary breakpoint at the next instruction.

This feature is particularly useful for stepping over call/rep instructions.

Ex: Step over call instruction

```text
stepover
```

```bash
gefâž¤  stepover
```
