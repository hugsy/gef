## Command `gef config` ##

`gef` reads its config from a file which is by default located at `~/.gef.rc`, but which
can also be specified via the `GEF_RC` environment variable. In addition, `gef` can also
be configured at runtime with the `gef config` command.

To view all settings for all commands loaded:
```
gef➤  gef config
```

Or to get one setting value:
```
gef➤  gef config pcustom.struct_path
```

Of course you can edit the values. For example, if you want the screen to be
cleared before displaying the current context when reaching a breakpoing:
```
gef➤  gef config context.clear_screen 1
```

To save the current settings for `GEF` to the file system to have those options
persist across all your future `GEF` sessions, simply run:
```
gef➤  gef save
[+] Configuration saved to '/home/vagrant/.gef.rc'
```

Upon startup, if `$GEF_RC` points to an existing file, or otherwise if
`${HOME}/.gef.rc` exists, `gef` will automatically load its values.

To reload the settings during the session, just run:
```
gef➤  gef restore
[+] Configuration from '/home/hugsy/.gef.rc' restored
```

You can tweak this configuration file outside your `gdb` session to suit your
needs.
