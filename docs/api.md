# Extending GEF #

`GEF` intends to provide a battery-included, quickly installable and crazy fast
debugging environment sitting on top of GDB.

But it most importantly provides all the primitives required to allow hackers to
quickly create their own commands. This page intends to summarize how to
create advanced GDB commands in moments using `GEF` as a library.

A [dedicated repository](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-extras) was born to host
[external scripts](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-extras/tree/master/scripts). This
repo is open to all for contributions, no restrictions and the most valuable
ones will be integrated into `gef.py`.

## Quick start ##

Here is the most basic skeleton for creating a new `GEF` command named `newcmd`:

```python
class NewCommand(GenericCommand):
    """Dummy new command."""
    _cmdline_ = "newcmd"
    _syntax_  = "{:s}".format(_cmdline_)

    @only_if_gdb_running         # not required, ensures that the debug session is started
    def do_invoke(self, argv):
        # do anything allowed by gef, for example show the current running
        # architecture as Python object:
        print(" = {}".format(current_arch) )
        # or showing the current $pc
        print("pc = {:#x}".format(current_arch.pc))
        return

register_external_command(NewCommand())
```

Yes, that's it!

Loading it in `GEF` is as easy as
```
gef➤  source /path/to/newcmd.py
[+] Loading 'NewCommand'
```

We can call it:

## Detailed explanation ##

Our new command must be a class that inherits from GEF's `GenericCommand`. The
*only* requirements are:

 * a `_cmdline_` attribute (the command to type on the GDB prompt).
 * a `_syntax_` attribute, which GEF will use to auto-generate the help menu.
 * a method `do_invoke(self, args)` which will be executed when the command
   is invoked. `args` is a list of the command line args provided when invoked.

We make GEF aware of this new command by registering it in the `__main__`
section of the script, by invoking the global function
`register_external_command()`.

Now you have a new GEF command which you can load, either from cli:
```
gef➤  source /path/to/newcmd.py
```
or add to your `~/.gdbinit`:
```
$ echo source /path/to/newcmd.py >> ~/.gdbinit
```

## API ##

Some of the most important parts of the API for creating new commands are
mentioned (but not limited to) below. To see the full help of a function, open
GDB and GEF, and use the embedded Python interpreter's `help` command. For
example:

```
gef➤  pi help(Architecture)
```

or even from outside GDB:

```bash
$ gdb -q -ex 'pi help(hexdump)' -ex quit
```


### Globals ###

```
register_external_command()
```
> Procedure to add the new GEF command


```
current_arch
```
> Global variable associated with the architecture of the currently debugged
> process. The variable is an instance of the `Architecture` class (see below).

```
read_memory(addr, length=0x10)
```
> Returns a `length` long byte array with a copy of the process memory read
> from `addr`.

```
write_memory(addr, buffer, length=0x10)
```
> Writes `buffer` to memory at address `addr`.


```
read_int_from_memory(addr)
```
> Reads the size of an integer from `addr`, and unpacks it correctly (based on
> the current arch's endianness)

```
read_cstring_from_memory(addr)
```
> Return a NULL-terminated array of bytes, from `addr`.


```
get_register(register_name)
```
> Returns the value of given register.


```
get_process_maps()
```
> Returns an array of Section objects (see below) corresponding to the current
> memory layout of the process.


```
gef_disassemble(addr, nb_insn, from_top=False)
```
> Disassemble `nb_insn` instructions after `addr`. If `from_top` is False
> (default), it will also disassemble the `nb_insn` instructions before `addr`.
> Return an iterator of Instruction objects (see below).


```
ok(msg)
info(msg)
warn(msg)
err(msg)
```
> Logging functions


```
gef_on_continue_hook
gef_on_continue_unhook
```
> Takes a callback function FUNC as parameter: add/remove a call to FUNC
> when GDB continues execution.

```
gef_on_stop_hook
gef_on_stop_unhook
```
> Takes a callback function FUNC as parameter: add/remove a call to FUNC
> when GDB stops execution (breakpoints, watchpoints, interrupt, signal, etc.).

```
gef_on_new_hook
gef_on_new_unhook
```
> Takes a callback function FUNC as parameter: add/remove a call to FUNC
> when GDB loads a new binary.

```
gef_on_exit_hook
gef_on_exit_unhook
```
> Takes a callback function FUNC as parameter: add/remove a call to FUNC
> when GDB exits an inferior.


### Decorators ###

```
@only_if_gdb_running
```
> Modifies a function to only execute if a GDB session is running. A GDB
> session is running if:
>
> * a PID exists for the targeted binary
> * GDB is running on a coredump of a binary


```
@only_if_gdb_target_local
```
> Checks if the current GDB session is local i.e. not debugging using GDB
> `remote`.


```
@only_if_gdb_version_higher_than( (MAJOR, MINOR) )
```
> Checks if the GDB version is higher or equal to the MAJOR and MINOR provided
> as arguments (both as Integers). This is required since some commands/API of
> GDB are only present in the very latest version of GDB.


### Classes ###

For exhaustive documentation, run
```bash
$ gdb -q -ex 'pi help(<ClassName>)' -ex quit
```

#### Generic ####

New GEF commands **must** inherit `GenericCommand`, have `_cmdline_` and
`_syntax_` attrivutes, and have a instance method `do_invoke(args)` defined.

Other than that, new commands can enjoy all the GEF abstract layer
representation classes, such as:

 * `Instruction` : GEF representation of instruction as pure Python objects.
 * `Address`: GEF representation of memory addresses.
 * `Section`: GEF representation of process memory sections.
 * `Permission`: Page permission object.
 * `Elf`: [ELF](http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf) parsing
   object.

#### Architectures ####

 * `Architecture`  : Generic metaclass for the architectures supported by GEF.
 * `ARM`
 * `AARCH64`
 * `X86`
 * `X86_64`
 * `PowerPC`
 * `PowerPC64`
 * `SPARC`
 * `SPARC64`
 * `MIPS`
 * `M68K`


#### Heap ####

 * `GlibcArena` : Glibc arena class
 * `GlibcChunk` : Glibc chunk class.
